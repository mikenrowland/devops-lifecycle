# DevOps Lifecycle in App Development


## 1. Foundational DevOps Concepts

### DevOps - definition
**DevOps** is a set of practices that bridges the gap between software development and IT operations, aiming to shorten the development lifecycle and deliver high-quality software continuously. It promotes collaboration, automation, and continuous improvement.

### Core DevOps principles briefly explained
- **Collaboration:** Breaking down silos between development and operations teams.
- **Automation:** Automating repetitive tasks to improve efficiency and consistency.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD):** Rapidly integrating and delivering code changes.
- **Monitoring and Feedback:** Using data and logs to improve performance and stability.
- **Culture of Learning:** Encouraging experimentation and continuous improvement.


## 2. DevOps Lifecycle Stages

- **Planning:** Define project requirements, goals, and timelines through stakeholder collaboration. Here decisions are are made on stacks, infrastructure and design.
- **Development:** Write and manage code using version control and agile practices. Most active stage of the lifecycle, several code iterations are involved.
- **Building:** Compile code, resolve dependencies, and generate build artifacts. Generally involves code optimization with minimal footprint.
- **Testing:** Run automated and manual tests to ensure quality and identify defects. Here we catch the bugs early.
- **Release:** Approve and prepare stable builds for production deployment.
- **Deployment:** Deploy applications to production using automated pipelines with minimal downtime.
- **Operations:** Manage infrastructure, configurations, and ensure system reliability. Sychronization of all the infrastruct into one cohesive unit.
- **Monitoring:** Continuously track system performance via audits and error logging. Also user feedback for proactive issue resolution and improvement.
